# Cosmic-Koi-Pond
Cosmic Koi Pond is an interactive projection driven by a Microsoft Kinect.

The installation will be on display during the summer festival on _May 20th_ and at the Leinwand Festival in autumn at [Hof University](http://hof-university.de/).

## Controls
The output is controlled by different gestures. You can wave with one arm to create fish and push both hands away from your torso to create a fish swarm. Pond skaters spawn randomly and everytime a new person gets detected, a lilypad spawns - staying there until the person leaves the field of view.
